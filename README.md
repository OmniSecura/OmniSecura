# üõ°Ô∏è About Project

Hi, my name is Bartosz Malujda and this is my cybersecurity project :). 
Recently i grown fond of secure coding and decided to make something to polish my skills in this direction, that's how the idea came upon me.

Welcome to OmniSecura Your personal cybersecurity hub where cutting-edge security meets innovation. Explore tools, tutorials, and secure-by-design solutions.
You will be able to find some tips and tricks i found during my 1.5 year journey in cybersecurity and 3 year journey as an IT student. 
The goal is to showcase my skils. projects and knowleadge while also let other people post their stuff for showcase.
In not so long period of time i hope to put it up so people can make and customize their own showcase portfolio like pages on my website. 
They wil be able to drag and drop a couple of prepared tiles to make it easy for customization :).
You can also read more about me on the page, thanks for stepping by, have fun :).
