# 👋 Hi, I'm Bartosz Malujda

🔐 Cybersecurity enthusiast | 💻 Software developer | 🧠 Threat detection & system analyst

I am passionate about **cybersecurity and programming**, with a strong focus on:

- detecting potential security threats and anomalies,
- network traffic analysis and monitoring,
- secure system architecture and backend development,
- automation and security tooling,
- combining AI/ML techniques with security systems.

I enjoy building practical projects that solve real-world problems and improve system reliability, privacy, and resilience.
